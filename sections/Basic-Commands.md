---

In this section, we will be looking at some basic git commands, what they do, and how to use them. Everything in this section will be about using git on your local machine to track your work. 

Before we start using git, we should tell it who we are. If this is your first time using git, run these two commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "<your github username>"
git config --global user.email "<your github email>"
```
