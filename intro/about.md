# Workshop Format
---
This workshop will be a live demonstration of using the Git version control system.

I'm going to be creating a very simple web site from scratch, showing how to use Git to save my work, safely modify it, and collaborate with other developers. 

In each section of the workshop, I'll talk about one Git command or concept, and demonstrate its usage in my project.

Most sections end with an exercise so that you can get some practice using Git.

So you can relax and listen, ask questions, and learn during the lecture, and then do some work on your own during the exercises.

I'll be using VSCode and the command line to create and modify files in this website project. If you'd like to follow me exactly, you should [download and install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).


If you don't have Git installed yet, you can follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
